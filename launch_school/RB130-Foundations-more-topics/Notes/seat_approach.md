## SEAT approach

1. Setup          =>  Setting up objects required for running tests
2. Execution      => Running the method that is being tested
3. Assertion      => Verifying that the execution returns what is expected
4. Teardown       => Closing the files after the tests are run

Minitest runs setup before and teardown after every test.
