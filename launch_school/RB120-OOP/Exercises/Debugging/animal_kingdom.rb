# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# the problem was with calling the super method with all three arguments
# passed in to the initialize method. When super is called without bracets,
# all the arguments passed to the initialize method gets passed to the
# super method. But this gives us an error because the initialize method
# in the parent class only takes two arguments, not three.

# the FlightlessBird initialize method is not necessary because it
# gets called by default.
