  <h1>Test Paragraph</h1>
  <p>For the beginning of the journey I don't think that a focus on projects alone is useful. It's better to learn the ideas in isolation for a while before trying to tie them together to make sure you really fully understand them. Once you have that foundation (Core) you can embark on more project-centric learning, such as Capstone. In my experience working as a developer, I've learned a lot from the projects I've taken on, but I don't think I could have if I didn't have the frame of mind that Core helped build through learning and memorizing concepts.</p>
