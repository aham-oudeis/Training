    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I am taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com" target="_blank">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
    </p>

    <p class="meta-comment" id="goal-comment">
      There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playiing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first &ndash; the &quot;class&quot; attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
    </p>

    <p class="meta-comment">
      This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
