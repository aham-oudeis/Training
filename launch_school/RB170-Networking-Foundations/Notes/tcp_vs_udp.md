# TCP vs UDP

1. While TCP is connection oriented, UDP is a connectionless protocol.
2. While TCP provides services like in-order delivery, acknowledgement, retransmission, UDP does not provide such services; as a result, TCP offers reliabillity, UDP does not.
3. TCP adds latency because of acknowledgement and in-order delivery functionality, UDP involves lower latency; as a result, data transfer is faster with UDP than TCP
